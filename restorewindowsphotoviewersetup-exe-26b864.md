RestoreWindowsPhotoViewerSetup.exe is an executable file associated with the software Restore Windows Photo Viewer, published by Authorsoft, and is designed to bring back the classic Windows Photo Viewer functionality that was removed in later versions of Windows, particularly Windows 10. The version 1.22.0.0 of this setup file is generally considered safe for users looking to restore their photo viewing experience; however, like any executable, it can be susceptible to false positives from antivirus software, leading to concerns about potential virus or malware presence. Users should download this file directly from the official Authorsoft website or reputable sources to mitigate risks, and it's advisable to conduct a virus scan after downloading to ensure the integrity of the file. Some users have reported errors during installation or functionality issues post-installation, but these are often linked to compatibility settings or system configurations rather than the executable itself being harmful. Overall, when sourced correctly, RestoreWindowsPhotoViewerSetup.exe is a practical tool for those wanting to revert to the traditional photo viewer experience on newer Windows operating systems.
