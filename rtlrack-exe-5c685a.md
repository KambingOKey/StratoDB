RtlRack.exe is an executable file associated with the Realtek ALC655 AC'97 Audio software, published by Dell Technologies, and it is typically found on systems using Realtek audio hardware. The file is generally considered safe and is a legitimate component of the audio drivers designed to enhance sound functionality on supported devices. However, like any executable file, it can sometimes be misidentified by antivirus programs, leading to false positive alerts, or it may become corrupted, resulting in errors such as malfunctioning audio or failure to initialize. Users experiencing issues with RtlRack.exe should ensure that their audio drivers are up to date and may consider scanning their systems for malware to rule out any potential threats, as malware can occasionally disguise itself with similar names.
